Notes for bash users:
  It's strongly recommended to install bash_completion. In this way you will have
  the best user experience.
  Linux users can install it using their package manager (apt, zypper, yum, emerge...),
  while OSX users can install it via ports, fink or brew.

  Now that jump is installed execute the following command:
    sudo cp `jump-bin --bash-integration`/bash_completion/jump /path_to/bash_completion.d

  The 'bash_completion.d' directory is usually located under /etc/.
  OSX users will find this directory under fink/port/brew installation directory (e.g. '/opt/local/etc').

  If you do not want to install <i>bash_completion</i> then add the following code
  to your bash configuration file (e.g. <i>~/.bash_profile</i> or <i>~/.bashrc'</i>:

    source `jump-bin --bash-integration`/shell_driver

  Beware: without bash_completion you won't be able use jump's advanced completion features.

Notes for zsh users:
  Now that jump is installed, add the following code to your .zshrc file:

    source `jump-bin --zsh-integration`
